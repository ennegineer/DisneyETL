## Extract, transform and load -- Disneyland data!

In this project, Sally and Enne are working with a set of Trip Advisor reviews of Disneyland. This data was filtered to look at only Disneyland California reviews, then filtered by date to look only at years 2014 through 2019.

We wrote a script to scrape data from a website containing weather and crowd information for Disneyland California for every day from September 1, 2014 through April 30, 2019. This scraped data was saved to a CSV to be imported into our transform file with the first dataset.
